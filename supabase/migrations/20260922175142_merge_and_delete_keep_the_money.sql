-- Merging a patient must not destroy their money, and deleting one must not
-- be able to reach a factura at all.
--
-- Two problems, one root: `patients` is the hub of twenty-three foreign keys,
-- nineteen of them `on delete cascade`, and the two places that remove a
-- patient row were both written before the money tables existed.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. merge_patients silently deleted the duplicate's payments
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- `merge_patients` (0160) moves eighteen child tables off the duplicate and
-- then deletes it, on the stated reasoning that "nothing points at the
-- duplicate any more, so the cascade has nothing left to take". That was true
-- when it was written. `payments` gained its `patient_id` afterwards and was
-- never added to the list, so the cascade had something to take after all:
--
--   payments_before_on_duplicate | 2
--   merged                       | t
--   payments_on_survivor_after   | 0
--   payments_still_anywhere      | 0
--
-- The merge REPORTS SUCCESS. It returns its per-table counts, the front desk
-- sees the two records become one, and the money that was on the duplicate is
-- gone -- not moved, not orphaned, deleted. A merge is the one operation
-- whose whole promise is that nothing is lost ("merge is strictly less
-- destructive than delete -- nothing is lost, it changes owner"), and for
-- payments it was doing the opposite of that.
--
-- This is not hypothetical on this account: the PracticeHub import left 18
-- duplicate pairs, and those are exactly the records with imported payments
-- on them.
--
-- `facturas` was missing from the same list, but failed loudly rather than
-- quietly -- see below -- so a merge of anyone holding one has simply been
-- impossible since facturas shipped.
--
-- Moving a factura between two records of the same person is safe under
-- VERI*FACTU, which is worth saying explicitly because it looks like it
-- should not be. The huella hashes IDEmisorFactura, NumSerieFactura,
-- FechaExpedicionFactura, TipoFactura, CuotaTotal, ImporteTotal, the previous
-- huella and FechaHoraHusoGenRegistro (see factura_huella_input). The patient
-- is not among them. Repointing `patient_id` therefore changes no hashed
-- field, leaves every huella valid and every chain intact, and
-- `factura_records` -- keyed by factura_id and account_id, not by patient --
-- is not touched at all.
--
-- The three `on delete set null` tables (email_messages, leads,
-- review_requests) are moved for the same reason whatsapp_messages already
-- was: they survive the delete, but with the link to the person cut, so a
-- lead that became a patient would quietly stop knowing who it became.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. facturas.patient_id cascaded, and only an accident stopped it
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- `facturas_patient_id_fkey` was `on delete cascade`, which reads as: delete
-- the patient and their fiscal documents go too. It never actually did that,
-- because `factura_records.factura_id` is RESTRICT and every factura has a
-- record (record_factura_alta fires on every insert, and there is no path
-- that skips it). So the delete was refused one table further down:
--
--   ERROR: update or delete on table "facturas" violates foreign key
--   constraint "factura_records_factura_id_fkey" on table "factura_records"
--
-- The chain was never at risk. But the guarantee lived in the wrong place:
-- it depended on a second table's constraint and on the invariant that every
-- factura has a record, rather than on the relationship it is actually about.
-- A factura that ever existed without its record -- a backfill, a trigger
-- disabled for a migration, an `anulacion`-only row -- and the cascade takes
-- it for real.
--
-- RESTRICT here says the thing directly, fails at the right table, and names
-- `facturas` in the error instead of sending whoever reads it into the
-- registro de facturación to work out what happened. DeleteDialog.vue already
-- refuses before reaching the database and explains why; this is the floor
-- under that, for the paths that do not go through the dialog.
--
-- Account deletion is unaffected. Nothing in the application deletes an
-- `accounts` row -- /api/account/delete.post.ts removes the auth user, and
-- `patients.user_id` is `on delete set null`, so the clinical record and its
-- legal retention are untouched. A hand-run `delete from accounts` on an
-- account holding facturas was already refused before this change (by the
-- factura_records append-only trigger, on the account_id cascade) and is
-- still refused after it.

-- One statement, so the table is never briefly without the constraint, and
-- so this reads as what it is -- a replacement, not a second relationship
-- between facturas and patients.

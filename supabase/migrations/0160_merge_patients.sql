-- Merging two records for the same person.
--
-- The permission has existed since the RBAC work -- `patients_delete_merge`,
-- and the patient header already gates Delete on it -- but only the delete
-- half was ever built. Deleting a duplicate is not merging it: every FK into
-- `patients` is `on delete cascade`, so deleting the record the front desk
-- thinks is "the empty one" takes its appointments, invoices, payments, bonos
-- and credit with it. On this account that is not hypothetical -- the
-- PracticeHub migration left 18 duplicate pairs, and in Sarra Belhocine's the
-- "empty" record is the one holding the Bono 12 and 176,00 of credit.
--
-- So merge has to move every child row before the delete, and there are
-- eighteen tables keyed off patient_id plus two self-references on `patients`
-- itself. Doing that from the browser is eighteen separate statements with no
-- transaction around them: a failure halfway leaves the person's history split
-- across two records with no record of which rows had already moved. Hence one
-- function, one transaction, all or nothing.
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER because the caller's RLS scope may legitimately not cover
-- every child table (a practitioner on 'own' patient scope can reach the
-- patient but not, say, payment_schedules), and a half-applied merge is worse
-- than a refused one. The definer rights are fenced by three checks below:
-- both records must be in one account, the caller must be a member of it, and
-- the caller must hold `patients_delete_merge` there. That is exactly the
-- permission the Delete button already demands, and merge is strictly less
-- destructive than delete -- nothing is lost, it changes owner.

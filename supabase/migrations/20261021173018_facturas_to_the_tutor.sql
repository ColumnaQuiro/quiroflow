-- A minor's facturas in their tutor's name. From the post-meeting notes,
-- 21 Oct 2026: a parent pays for a child's treatment, and the factura they
-- take to their insurer or to Hacienda has to carry THEIR name and NIF, not
-- the child's -- who usually has no DNI at all, so a full factura (a bono, a
-- membership, anything over 400 EUR) could not even be sent to the AEAT.
--
-- patients.bill_to_tutor is the switch, per minor, next to their tutor
-- (Datos del paciente). Off by default: the clinic says so for each child.
--
-- Decided when the factura is issued, not when it is read. A factura names
-- its recipient from the moment it exists; switching the option later must
-- not readdress documents already handed over or already sent to the AEAT
-- under the child's name. So a BEFORE INSERT trigger records the tutor in
-- facturas.recipient_patient_id -- on every path that issues one
-- (issue_factura from the desk and the app, issueFacturaServer for Stripe,
-- gift vouchers, product sales), none of which has to change. A rectificativa
-- goes to whoever the factura it corrects went to.
--
-- Who that is stays live, as for the patient: recipient_name/nif/address left
-- null resolve from the RECIPIENT's record when the document is rendered and
-- the record sent (facturaData.ts, verifactuSender.ts), so a tutor's NIF
-- added next week reaches a factura issued today, as a patient's always has.
--
-- Not a foreign key, deliberately. facturas already has one to patients
-- (patient_id), and a second makes every PostgREST embed of patients(...)
-- from facturas ambiguous -- "more than one relationship was found" -- which
-- would break the PDF and the billing tab of the code live in production the
-- moment this applies, before the release that knows to disambiguate. What a
-- foreign key would have given is done by hand: merge_patients moves it
-- (restated below from 20261021171628 with that one statement), and
-- DeleteDialog refuses to delete a tutor with facturas addressed to them,
-- as it does a patient with their own.

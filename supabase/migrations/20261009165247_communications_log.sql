-- Reports > Communications: every message the clinic sent a patient or lead,
-- on every channel, in one list -- the PracticeHub "Communication Logs".
--
-- Three channels already keep a row per message (whatsapp_messages,
-- email_messages, patient_app_messages). Push did not: a push to a patient
-- (an appointment change, "Nuevo ejercicio para casa", the exercise reminder)
-- left no trace anywhere, so patient_push_log starts recording them, one row
-- per patient per send (server/utils/pushNotifications.ts). Broadcasts keep
-- their own table (patient_push_broadcasts) and appear once each.
--
-- communications_log is a security_invoker view over all of them, so each
-- part keeps its own table's policy: WhatsApp needs inbox_access, email and
-- push follow the member's patient scope. Dry runs ("would_send", dry_run)
-- were never sent and are left out.
